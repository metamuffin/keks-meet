# keks-meet

a simple secure web conferencing application

## Features

- Ability to share different kinds of media:
  - Camera
  - Microphone
  - Screen capture
  - Files
- End-to-end-encryption (including chat, p2p negotiation)
- Peer-to-peer data transmission
- Multiple streams of any type
- Noise suppression (using RNNoise)
- Rooms (created on demand, do not persist)
- Chat (supports text and images)
- Minimal user-interface
- Should work with screen readers
- Easy Installation through a single binary with a decently small resource
  footprint. (Ca. 9MB binary and about the same memory usage.)

## Licence

keks-meet is licensed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License
version 3 only. See [COPYING](./COPYING).

## Usage

For trying it out, a hosted version is available on
[meet.metamuffin.org](https://meet.metamuffin.org/). For self-hosting, this
should help:

```sh
pacman -S --needed esbuild rustup make coreutils curl tar; rustup install nightly
git clone https://codeberg.org/metamuffin/keks-meet.git
cd keks-meet
make install-server # binaries will be installed to ~/.cargo/bin
keks-meet-server config/default.toml
```

The server's bind address can be controlled using the `BIND` environment
variable. When compiling without debug assertions (release) all assets are
embedded into the binary; This is a speedup and allows the server to run from
just the binary and the configuration.

The server takes a path to the configuration file as its first argument unless
the `embed_config` feature is used. In that case, the configuration is read from
`config/config.toml` and embedded into the server binary.

When changing code, use `make watch` to re-build things automatically as needed.
(requires `cargo install systemfd cargo-watch`)

## _Rift_

_Rift_ is similar to the
[magic wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole), except that
it's peer-to-peer and intends to provide better security. It reuses the
keks-meet signaling protocol to establish a WebRTC data channel for the file
transfer.

```sh
pacman -S --needed rustup; rustup install nightly
cargo +nightly install --path client-native-rift
rift --help
```

```sh
rift --secret hunter2 send /path/to/file &
rift --secret hunter2 receive /path/to/output
```

## Security

keks-meet _tries_ to be secure. However I am not a security expert. The current
system works as follows:

- The room name is set in the section of the URL which is not sent to the
  server.
- The server receives a salted SHA-512 hash of the room name to group clients of
  a room.
- The client uses PBKDF2 (constant salt; 250000 iterations) to derive a 512-bit
  AES-GCM key from the room name.
- All relayed message contents are encrypted with this key.
  - Message recipient is visible to the server
  - The server assigns user ids

## Keybinds

| Keybind | Action                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `C-RET` | Toggle chat                                             |
| `M`     | Add microphone track                                    |
| `R`     | Add microphone track (but with your left hand)          |
| `C`     | Add camera track                                        |
| `S`     | Add screencast track                                    |
| `C-c`   | End all tracks                                          |
| `C-v`\* | Paste image in chat (does not require chat to be shown) |

## Debugging

- If a connection cant be established, look at it with `webrtc_debug` enabled.
- In case downloading files doesn't work, check if the service worker was
  installed correctly by visiting `/swtest`
- If it still doesn't work, file a bug report.

## Parameters

Some configuration parameters can be added like query params but **after** the
section. (e.g `/room#mymeeting?username=alice`) The page will not automatically
reload if the section changes. Booleans can be either `1`, `true`, `yes` or
their opposites. A convenience function for changing params is also exported:
`window.change_pref(key, value)`

## Protocol

The protocol packets are defined in [packets.d.ts](./common/packets.d.ts). Here
are some simplified examples of how the protocol is used.

```
S->C    { init: { your_id: 5, version: "..." } }
----    # Your join packet will be the first one.
S->C    { client_join: { id: 5 } }
S->C    { client_join: { id: 3 } }
----    # The server doesnt know people's names so they identify themselves.
S->C    { message: { sender: 3, message: <Encrypted { identify: { username: "Alice" } }> } }
----    # You should do that too.
C->S    { relay: { message: <Encrypted { identify: { username: "Bob" } }> } }
----    # Publish your ICE candidates.
C->S    { relay: { message: <Encrypted { ice_candiate: <RTCIceCandidateInit> }> } }
----    # If you create a resource, tell others about it:
C->S    { relay: { message: <Encrypted { provide: { id: "asd123", label: "Camera", kind: "track", track_kind: "video" } }> } }
----    # If somebody is interested in this resource, they will request you to transmit.
S->C    { message: { sender: 3, message: <Encrypted { request: { id: "asd123" } }> } }
----    # Whenever you change your tracks/data channels:
----    # Send an offer to everybody
C->S    { relay: <Encrypted { recipient: 3, offer: <RTCSessionDescriptionInit> }> }
----    # Await answer:
S->C    { message: { sender: 3, message: <Encrypted { offer: <RTCSessionDescriptionInit> }> } }
----    # In case the server uses a reverse-proxy that disconnects inactive connections: Ping every 30s
C->S    { ping: null }
```

If you decide to implement this protocol, please make sure it is compatible,
especially ensure that channels/tracks are only added on request and to not
reuse existing identifiers for new protocol packets.
