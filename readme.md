## Security

keks-meet _tries_ to be secure. However I am not a security expert. The current system works as follows:

-   The room name is set in the section of the URL which is not sent to the server.
-   The server receives a salted SHA-256 hash of the room name to group clients of a room.
-   The client uses PBKDF2 (constant salt; 250000 iterations) to derive a 256-bit AES-GCM key from the room name.
-   All relayed message contents are encrypted with this key.
    -   Message recipient is visible to the server
    -   The server assigns user ids

## Usage

For trying it out, a hosted version is available on [my server](https://meet.metamuffin.org/).
For self-hosting, this script should do:

```
git clone https://codeberg.org/metamuffin/keks-meet.git
cd keks-meet
make -C client-web
cd server
cargo run --release
```

Because of a current compiler bug, the nightly rustc crashes during codegen - use the stable channel instead.

## Parameters

Configuration parameters are added like query params but **after** the section. (e.g `/room#mymeeting?username=alice`)
The page will not automatically reload if the section changes.
Booleans can be either `1`, `true`, `yes` or their opposites.

## Todo-List

-   Optionally enable video streams
-   Settings menu
-   Native client
-   Prevent server from changing message sender
-   Have a security professional look at the code
-   Test some options like `camera_facing_mode`
-   Signing key for each user
    -   Built-in storage for known keys
-   Relay RTC when there are a lot of clients
-   Mitigate security issues caused by `*_enabled` params

## Protocol

The protocol packets are defined in [packets.d.ts](./common/packets.d.ts). Here is an (simplified) example of how the protocol is used.

```
S->C    { init: { your_id: 5, version: "..." } }
----    # Your join packet will be the first one.
S->C    { client_join: { id: 5, name: "bob" } }
S->C    { client_join: { id: 3, name: "alice" } }
----    # Now publish your ICE candidates
C->S    { relay: { message: { ice_candiate: <RTCIceCandidateInit> } } }
----    # Whenever you change your streams change:
----    # Send an offer to everybody
C->S    { relay: { recipient: 3, offer: <RTCSessionDescriptionInit> } }
----    # Alice answers
S->C    { message: { sender: 3, message: { offer: <RTCSessionDescriptionInit> } } }
----    # In case the server uses a reverse-proxy that disconnects inactive connections: Ping every 30s
C->S    { ping: null }
```
